ABSTRACT
Since more and more xenobiotic compounds are being found in the environment, ecotoxicology faces an overwhelming challenge in the identification of toxicants. The combination of high-throughput in vivo/in vitro bioassays with high resolution chemical analysis is an effective way to elucidate cause-effect relationship. However, these combined strategies imply an enormous workload that can hinder their implementation in a routine analysis. The purpose of this study was to develop a new high-throughput screening methodology based on image analysis and machine learning to ease the application of  the sea urchin embryo bioassay in complex toxicant identification pipelines such as effect-directed analysis. A training set of 242 images was used to calibrate the larvae size-increase and malformation level classification. Two classification models based on partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were built and compared. Moreover, Hierarchical PLS-DA shows a high proficiency in classifying the larvae, achieving a prediction accuracy of 84% in validation.. The scripts built along the work were compiled in a user-friendly standalone app  (SETApp) freely accessible at https://github.com/UPV-EHU-IBeA/SETApp. The SETApp was tested in a real case scenario to fulfil the tedious requirements of a WWTP effect-directed analysis.
